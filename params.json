This is a silly little thing I thought of on the train\r\nto see if I could get anywhere with this problem. \r\n\r\n### ASTs and SPTs\r\n\r\nIt _should_ be possible to specify program behavior with just swipes and large-target taps. I think. Skipping the code and working directly with the Syntax Tree seems like it could be a good start. Interpreting the Syntax Tree as a Space Partitioning Tree seems like it'd be an efficient way to display the information on a tiny screen.\r\n\r\n### Demo!\r\n(put demo form here)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
